# Football Match Analytics


This repository contains a Python-based project for analyzing football match footage using computer vision techniques. The project leverages advanced object detection and tracking algorithms to extract meaningful data, including player and ball tracking, team identification, and performance metrics like speed and distance covered. The modular design makes it extensible and suitable for researchers, developers, and sports analysts interested in football analytics.
Features

Player and Ball Tracking: Employs state-of-the-art object detection (e.g., YOLO) and tracking algorithms to accurately follow players and the football across video frames.
Team Assignment: Automatically classifies players into their respective teams based on visual cues, enabling team-specific analysis.
Speed and Distance Estimation: Calculates individual player speeds and total distance covered during a match, providing insights into player performance.
Camera Movement Estimation: Compensates for camera motion to ensure a stable reference frame, improving the accuracy of tracking and metrics.
Jupyter Notebooks: Includes player_assigment.ipynb, a notebook demonstrating the team assignment process with visualizations.
Modular Design: Structured into separate modules for each task, making it easy to modify, extend, or integrate with other systems.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Dependencies: The project relies on several Python libraries, listed in requirements.txt. Key dependencies include:
numpy: For numerical computations.
opencv-python: For image and video processing.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For visualizations.
Machine learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the YOLO implementation).


Hardware: A GPU is recommended for faster processing of video data, especially for deep learning models.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/AbhinavKumar0000/Football_match_analytics.git
cd Football_match_analytics


Install Dependencies:Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

If additional frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow are needed, follow their official installation guides:

PyTorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/install


Download Pre-trained Models (if applicable):Some components, such as the YOLO model in yolo_instance.py, may require pre-trained weights. Check the specific module documentation or yolo_instance.py for instructions on downloading or configuring these models.


Running the Analysis
To analyze a football match video, run the main script with the path to your video file:
python main.py --video_path /path/to/your/video.mp4


Input: The script expects a video file (e.g., .mp4) containing football match footage.
Output: Results, such as tracking data, team assignments, and player metrics, will be saved to a designated output directory (configured in main.py).

To explore the team assignment process interactively, open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook player_assigment.ipynb

Usage Example
python main.py --video_path sample_match.mp4 --output_dir results/

This command processes sample_match.mp4, tracks players and the ball, assigns teams, estimates speeds and distances, and saves results to the results/ directory.
